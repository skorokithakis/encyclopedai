EncyclopedAI Homepage Enhancement TODO
=====================================

Current State:
- Hero section with centered search (KEEP VERY PROMINENT)
- "Articles of interest" with 4 latest articles (minimal previews)
- "Random articles" with 20 article titles as pills
- Wikipedia-inspired aesthetic with serif typography

---

HIGH PRIORITY - Quick Wins
===========================

[ ] 2. Add metadata to article cards
    - Show publication date (article.created_at)
    - Calculate and display reading time estimate (based on content length)
    - Add "Updated" indicator if updated_at differs significantly from created_at
    - Style as small badges or metadata line

[ ] 3. Improve article card styling
    - Add better spacing between cards
    - Enhance hover states (current implementation is basic)
    - Add subtle shadows for depth
    - Add clear "Read article →" or similar CTA
    - Consider slightly larger cards with more breathing room

[ ] 5. Reorganize random articles section
    Option A: Reduce to smaller curated "Explore more" (8-10 articles)
    Option B: Group into themed clusters if we can detect topics
    Option C: Replace with prominent "Random article" button
    - Current 20-pill layout is overwhelming and low-value
    - Makes page end feel cluttered

---

MEDIUM PRIORITY - More Engagement
==================================

[ ] 8. Improve visual hierarchy of entire page
    - Review spacing between sections
    - Ensure search remains the dominant element
    - Create better visual flow down the page
    - Consider max-width constraints for readability

[ ] 9. Enhanced hover interactions
    - Expandable previews (show more summary on hover/click)
    - Smooth transitions
    - Preview expansion without navigation (optional)

[ ] 10. Add "Surprise me" / "Random article" button
     - More prominent than current random article links
     - Place near search or in header
     - Direct navigation to random article

---

LOWER PRIORITY - Nice to Have
==============================

[ ] 11. Search enhancements (without reducing prominence)
     - Show rotating example queries ("Try: Solar system, Quantum mechanics...")
     - Add recent popular searches if tracking is implemented
     - Make autocomplete/suggestions more visible

[ ] 12. Category/topic exploration
     - If articles have topics/tags, show "Explore by topic" sections
     - Requires topic detection or tagging system
     - Could be manual or automated

---

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

Available but underutilized:
- Article.summary_snippet (AI-generated, not used on homepage)
- Article.content_preview (used, but could be enhanced)
- Rich markdown content available for previews

Design constraints to maintain:
- Wikipedia-inspired aesthetic (serif headings, sans-serif UI)
- Minimal color palette (black text, blue links, subtle grays)
- No decorative imagery or complex graphics
- Typography-focused, content-first approach
- Search box must remain hero element

Existing patterns to leverage:
- Card-based layouts (static/css/main.css lines 652-724)
- Grid system (already responsive)
- Pill-style links (static/css/main.css lines 773-832)
- Hover effects throughout site

Backend considerations:
- View: main/views.py lines 21-51 (index function)
- Model: main/models.py lines 13-102 (Article model)
- Markdown rendering: main/services.py
- Template filter: main/templatetags/markdown_filters.py
