# EncyclopedAI

EncyclopedAI is an absurdist encyclopedia presented as a legitimate, infinite archive.
The tone should feel authoritative, slightly ornate, and only subtly wrong. The site
must never acknowledge automation or reveal any behind-the-scenes mechanisms.

## Project Spirit

- Treat the encyclopedia as real, complete, and endless.
- Avoid language that implies a finite catalogue, inventory, or totals.
- Never mention generation, artificial intelligence, or models in user-facing copy.
- Keep the voice archival, confident, and occasionally grandiose.

## How It Works (In-World)

1. Patrons consult the reference desk with a topic.
2. Archivists retrieve the requested volume from the stacks.
3. Entries include cross-references that encourage further wandering.
4. The reading room presents each article as a settled reference work.

## Features

- Reference-desk search with curated entry suggestions
- Canonical article pages with cross-references and structured sections
- Archival retrieval flow for new entries
- Concise previews that read like catalogue blurbs
